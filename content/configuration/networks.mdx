title: Networks
description: Configure which Stellar networks your app supports.
---

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `networks` option defines which Stellar networks your app supports. If a connected wallet is on a network not in this list, Blux will prompt the user to switch.

## Available Networks
```ts
import { core } from "@bluxcc/core";

// core.networks exposes:
{
  mainnet:    'Public Global Stellar Network ; September 2015',
  testnet:    'Test SDF Network ; September 2015',
  sandbox:    'Local Sandbox Stellar Network ; September 2022',
  futurenet:  'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022',
  standalone: 'Standalone Network ; February 2017',
}
```

## Usage

<Tabs items={['React', 'Vanilla JS']}>
<Tab value="React">
```tsx
<BluxProvider
  config={{
    appName: "MyApp",
    networks: [networks.mainnet, networks.testnet],
    defaultNetwork: networks.mainnet,
  }}
>
  {children}
</BluxProvider>
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Vanilla JS">
```ts
import { core } from "@bluxcc/core";

createConfig({
  appName: "My App",
  networks: [core.networks.mainnet, core.networks.testnet],
  defaultNetwork: core.networks.mainnet,
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you only pass one network, `defaultNetwork` is optional — Blux will use the first item in the array automatically. You can change the active network later using `switchNetwork()`.

<Callout type="info">
  Network switching prompts only appear for wallets that support `getNetwork()`, such as Rabet and Freighter. You can disable this behavior entirely by setting `promptOnWrongNetwork: false` in your config.
</Callout>

## Custom Networks

If you need a network not in the built-in list, define it as a string and pass it to the `networks` array:
```ts
const customNetwork = "Standalone Network ; February 2020";

createConfig({
  appName: "MyApp",
  networks: [customNetwork],
});
```

Make sure to also define a transport for any custom network. See the Transports page for details.

## Auto Sync

Blux periodically checks the connected wallet's active network. By default, it keeps the app's network in sync with the wallet — as long as the wallet's network is one of the supported networks in your config.

If your app calls `switchNetwork()` directly, Blux treats that as an app-controlled override and disables automatic syncing from that point on to prevent conflicts.

### Example

Given this config:
```ts
{
  networks: [networks.testnet, networks.futurenet],
}
```

| Step | Event | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Alice connects Freighter on **Mainnet** | Mainnet is unsupported → Wrong Network modal shown, app stays on **Testnet** |
| 2 | Alice switches Freighter to **Futurenet** | Supported → modal closes, app switches to **Futurenet** |
| 3 | Alice switches Freighter to **Testnet** | Supported → app auto-syncs to **Testnet** |
| 4 | App calls `switchNetwork(futurenet)` | App moves to **Futurenet**, auto-sync is now disabled |
| 5 | Alice toggles between Testnet/Futurenet | Wallet changes, app stays on **Futurenet** |
| 6 | Alice switches to **Mainnet** | Unsupported → Wrong Network modal, app stays on **Futurenet** |
| 7 | Alice switches back to **Testnet** | Modal dismissed, but app still stays on **Futurenet** (auto-sync still off) |
