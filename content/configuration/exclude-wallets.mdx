title: Exclude Wallets
description: Control which wallets appear in the Blux login modal.
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The `excludeWallets` option lets you hide specific wallets from the login modal. This is useful when certain wallets don't support features your app depends on — such as `signMessage` or `getNetwork` — helping you avoid user confusion and potential runtime errors.

## Type
```ts
type IWalletNames = Array<
  | "rabet"
  | "albedo"
  | "freighter"
  | "xbull"
  | "lobstr"
  | "hana"
  | "hot"
  | "klever"
  | "walletConnect"
>;
```

## Default Behavior

By default, Blux excludes `lobstr`. We recommend keeping this unless you have a specific reason to include them.

**Why LOBSTR is excluded** — LOBSTR's `isAvailable()` takes ~2 seconds to respond. During that time, `blux.isReady` stays `false`, which blocks `blux.login()` from opening the modal. If you want to support LOBSTR users, use WalletConnect instead — it connects instantly without requiring the extension or affecting `isReady`.


## Usage
```ts
// Default behavior — applied automatically if not specified
createConfig({
  excludeWallets: ["lobstr"],
});

// Include all wallets with no exclusions
createConfig({
  excludeWallets: [],
});

// Custom exclusion list
createConfig({
  excludeWallets: ["freighter", "albedo", "rabet"],
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Including LOBSTR directly may cause delays or unreliable wallet detection. Prefer WalletConnect for LOBSTR support.
