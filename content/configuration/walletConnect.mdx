Adding the `walletConnect` object to your config enables WalletConnect as a login option. Once configured, users will see a **Wallet Connect** option in the login modal.

## Usage
```ts
createConfig({
  appName: "My App",
  networks: [core.networks.mainnet],
  walletConnect: {
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    url: "https://yourapp.com",
    description: "A short description of your app",
    icons: ["https://yourapp.com/icon.png"],
  },
});
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `projectId` | `string` | Your WalletConnect project ID — get one from the [WalletConnect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) |
| `url` | `string` | The URL of your app, used to identify it during the connection flow |
| `description` | `string` | A short description of your app shown inside the wallet |

  WalletConnect is the recommended way to support LOBSTR users, as it connects instantly without requiring the browser extension. See [Exclude Wallets](/configuration/exclude-wallets) for more context.
