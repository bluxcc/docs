title: Get Strict Receive Paths
description: Fetch strict receive payment paths using the Blux core SDK.
---

The `getStrictReceivePaths` function returns available payment paths for a strict receive operation.

The return value contains two properties:
- `response` — the records you can use directly
- `builder` — exposes `next()` and `prev()` to paginate through results

## Type
```tsx
export type CallBuilderOptions = {
  cursor?: string;
  limit?: number;
  network?: string;
  order?: "asc" | "desc";
};

type GetPaymentPathResult = {
  builder: PathCallBuilder;
  response: Horizon.ServerApi.CollectionPage<Horizon.ServerApi.PaymentPathRecord>;
};
```

## Usage
```typescript
import { core } from "@bluxcc/core";

const result = await core.getStrictReceivePaths(
  [
    source: string | Asset[],
    destinationAsset: Asset,
    destinationAmount: string,
  ], options);
```
