import { Card, Cards } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/card';
import { getPageTreePeers } from 'fumadocs-core/page-tree';
import { source } from '@/lib/source';

The `blux` object is your main interface for interacting with connected users. Once a user is authenticated, you can open the profile modal, submit transactions, sign messages, and more — all with built-in UI handled for you.
```ts
import { blux } from "@bluxcc/core";
```

<Cards>
  {getPageTreePeers(source.getPageTree(), '/javascript/usage').map((peer) => (
    <Card key={peer.url} title={peer.name} href={peer.url}>
      {peer.description}
    </Card>
  ))}
</Cards>
