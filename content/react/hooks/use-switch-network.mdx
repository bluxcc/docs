title: useSwitchNetwork
---

The `useSwitchNetwork` hook is used to change the current active network.

:::tip

Switching the active network will impact components like the profile modal and hooks such
as `useBalance`, `useAccount`, `useTransactions`, and others if the network parameter
is not explicitly provided to these hooks.

:::

### Usage

```tsx
import { networks, useSwitchNetwork } from "@bluxcc/react";

const Comp = () => {
  const { switchNetwork } = useSwitchNetwork();

  const changeNetwork = () => {
    switchNetwork(networks.mainnet);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={changeNetwork}>Change network to mainnet</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
