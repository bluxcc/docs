Blux provides two categories of React hooks: hooks for **managing wallet state** (authentication, network, transactions) and hooks for **querying Stellar network data** (accounts, balances, trades, and more).

All data-fetching hooks are built on [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v5) and support the full suite of query options including caching, background refetching, pagination, and dependent queries.
