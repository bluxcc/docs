title: Login
---

Blux supports easy onboarding with an out-of-the-box user interface to log users in.

To have users login to your app, use the `login` method from the useBlux hook.

The `useBlux` hook provides four key fields to manage user authentication:

    - `isReady` Indicates whether Blux has finished checking for available wallets.
        - Initially `false`.
        - Becomes `true` once the wallet check is complete.
    - `isAuthenticated` Tracks the user’s login state.
        - `false` by default.
        - Becomes `true` after a successful login.
        - Returns to `false` on logout.
    - `user` Contains user information after login.
        - Initially `null`.
        - After login, becomes an object with details like wallet address and connection method.
        - Resets to `null` on logout.
    - `login()` Triggers a modal that lets the user choose from available wallets to log in.
    - `logout()` 
        - To sign the user out.
        - Resets `isAuthenticated` to `false`. 
        - Resets `user` back to `null`.

:::tip

Tip: Keep the Connect button disabled until isReady is set to true.

```tsx
import { useBlux } from '@bluxcc/react';

function LoginButton() {
    const { login, isReady, isAuthenticated } = useBlux();

    const disableLogin = !isReady || (isReady && isAuthenticated);

    return (
        <button disabled={disableLogin} onClick={login}>
            Log in
        </button>
    );
}
```
